# [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) workflows

Currently making workflow for [flow](https://github.com/nikivdev/flow) amongst other things in future.

## Contributing

Make issues with bugs/features or submit PRs. [flow](https://github.com/nikivdev/flow) has many utils to make this easy. PRs with ideas if they are great will eventually be merged too. Bug fixing is always welcome, perf improvements should ideally have some benchmark attached. Docs can always be better. See [this](https://nikiv.dev/how-i-code) for how to code fast with AI.
